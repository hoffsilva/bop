# BOP
Bag of Popcorn (BOP) is an iOS application that shows the upcomig movies from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) Api.

## Project Description

    As a mobile engineer you've been tasked with the development of an app for cinephiles and movie hobbyists. This first version (MVP) of the app will be very simple and limited to show the list of upcoming movies. The app will be fed with content from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). No design specs were given, so you're free to follow your UX and UI personal preferences. However the app should work both in *landscape and portrait* orientations. The choice of platform (iOS, Android, Xamarin) and development approach is also for you to decide based on previous experience and/or personal interest.

## Functional Requirements

    The first release of the app will be very limited in scope, but will serve as the foundation for future releases. It's expected that user will be able to:
* Scroll through the list of upcoming movies - including movie *name*, *poster or backdrop image*, *genre* and *release date*. List *should not be limited to show only the first 20 movies* as returned by the API.
* Select a specific movie to see details (name, poster image, genre, overview and release date).
* (Optional) Search for movies by entering a partial or full movie name.

## Technical Requirements
    You should see this project as an opportunity to create an app following modern development best practices (given your platform of choice), but also feel free to use your own app architecture preferences (coding standards, code organization, third-party libraries, etc).
    A TMDb API key is already available so you don't need to request your own:

The API documentation and examples of use can be found here:

Feel free to use package/dependency managers (ex: Maven, CocoaPods, etc) if you see fit.
